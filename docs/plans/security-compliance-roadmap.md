## Current State

**Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum with session-based auth implemented. 2FA properly enforces session flag after verification.

**Authorization**: Group-based RBAC implemented via user_groups system.

**Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging with HIPAA-compliant access logs.

**Encryption**: HTTPS enforced, Laravel encryption for sensitive data.

**Password Policy**: Strong passwords enforced (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols). Compromised password check in production.

**Token Expiration**: API tokens expire after 7 days (configurable via `SANCTUM_TOKEN_EXPIRATION`).

**SSRF Protection**: UrlValidationService prevents internal/private URL access across all HTTP fetch operations.

**OAuth Security**: State token validation prevents CSRF attacks on SSO flows.

**Webhook Security**: HMAC-SHA256 signatures for webhook payload verification.

**File Upload**: Default whitelist blocks dangerous file types; MIME validation prevents extension spoofing.

**Security Headers**: nginx configured with X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, and Content-Security-Policy.

**CORS**: Restricted to specific HTTP methods and headers; preflight cached for 24 hours.

**Rate Limiting**: Auth-sensitive routes (login, register, password reset, 2FA) protected via `rate.sensitive` middleware.

---

## SAST Implementation (Complete)

Automated security scanning is integrated into CI/CD:

**PHP (Backend):**
- **PHPStan** with strict rules and Larastan (`backend/phpstan.neon`)
- Run locally: `composer phpstan` in `backend/`

**JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend):**
- **ESLint security plugin** (`frontend/.eslintrc.json`)
- Run locally: `npm run lint` in `frontend/`

**Full Codebase:**
- **Semgrep** with `p/security-audit`, `p/php-laravel`, `p/typescript`, `p/owasp-top-ten`
- Runs automatically in CI on push/PR to main

**Local Development:**
- Run `./scripts/security-scan.sh` to execute all security checks locally
- Use `--quick` to skip Semgrep for faster iteration
- Use `--fix` to auto-fix ESLint issues
