# Logging Standards

Application and console logging for Sourdough: backend structured logging, frontend error reporting, and configuration.

## When to Log (and What Level)

| Level | Use for |
|-------|--------|
| **debug** | Detailed flow (development only). Not typically used in application code. |
| **info** | Normal operations: backup created, email sent, LLM query completed, scheduled job finished. |
| **warning** | Recoverable issues: provider failed (others succeeded), password reset failed, backup restore started. |
| **error** | Failures: email send failed, backup failed, client error reported. |
| **critical** | Unrecoverable (reserved for severe system failures). |

Use **structured context** (arrays) with every log: include `user_id`, `provider`, `duration_ms`, `error` (message only), or other relevant identifiers. Do not log secrets, passwords, or full request bodies.

## Backend Logging

### Configuration

- **LOG_CHANNEL**: `stack` (default) – uses channels from LOG_STACK.
- **LOG_STACK**: Comma-separated channels, e.g. `single`, `daily`, or `single,json`. Add `broadcast` for real-time admin log streaming.
- **LOG_LEVEL**: `debug` (development), `info` (staging), `warning` (production).
- **LOG_DAILY_DAYS**: Retention in days when using the `daily` channel (default 14).
- **LOG_BROADCAST_ENABLED**: Set `true` to stream logs to the admin Application Logs page (requires Pusher and `broadcast` in LOG_STACK).
- **LOG_BROADCAST_LEVEL**: Minimum level to broadcast (`info`, `warning`, `error`; default `info`).

Add `json` to LOG_STACK for JSON output to stderr (correlation_id, user_id, request_uri in each line). Use for production or containers with log aggregation.

### Structured Logging

All logs go through the default channel(s). The **ContextProcessor** adds to every log record:

- `correlation_id` – from `AddCorrelationId` middleware (or generated per request).
- `user_id` – when authenticated.
- `ip_address` – request IP.
- `request_uri` – request path.

Use the `Log` facade with a message and context array:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

Log::info('Backup created', ['filename' => $filename, 'size' => $size]);
Log::warning('LLM provider failed', ['provider' => $name, 'error' => $e->getMessage()]);
Log::error('Email send failed', ['user_id' => $user->id, 'error' => $e->getMessage()]);
```

### Log Rotation

Use the `daily` channel for file logging to get automatic rotation:

- Set `LOG_STACK=daily` or `LOG_STACK=daily,json`.
- Retention is controlled by `LOG_DAILY_DAYS` (default 14).

## Frontend Error Reporting

Use the **errorLogger** utility instead of `console.error` / `console.warn` for errors that should be visible in backend logs.

### errorLogger (frontend/lib/error-logger.ts)

- **report(error, context?)**: Report an `Error` (e.g. from catch or error boundary). Sends to `POST /api/client-errors` with stack and optional context.
- **captureMessage(message, level?, context?)**: Report a message at `info`, `warning`, or `error` (default `error`).

The API client stores `X-Correlation-ID` from response headers; error reports include it when available so backend logs can correlate client errors with requests.

### Error Boundary

The app is wrapped in an **ErrorBoundary** that reports React render errors via `errorLogger.report()` and shows a fallback UI. Global `window.onerror` and `unhandledrejection` are also reported via **ErrorHandlerSetup**.

### Usage

```ts
import { errorLogger } from "@/lib/error-logger";

try {
  await api.get("/something");
} catch (error) {
  errorLogger.report(
    error instanceof Error ? error : new Error("Something failed"),
    { source: "my-page" }
  );
}

errorLogger.captureMessage("No fields to update", "warning");
```

## Live Console Log Viewer (Admin)

Configuration > **Application Logs** (`/configuration/logs`) streams application logs in real time when:

- `LOG_BROADCAST_ENABLED=true`
- `broadcast` is in `LOG_STACK`
- Pusher is configured (`BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher`)
- User is admin (private `app-logs` channel)

Logs are broadcast via `AppLogCreated`; the **BroadcastLogHandler** sanitizes sensitive context before sending.

### Application Logs Export (Admin)

Configuration > **Application Logs** includes an **Export** section. Admins can export application log files (from `storage/logs/laravel*.log`) as CSV or JSON Lines, filtered by date range, level, and correlation ID. Endpoint: `GET /api/app-logs/export?date_from=&date_to=&level=&correlation_id=&format=csv|json`.

## HIPAA Access Logging

**Access Logs** (`/configuration/access-logs`) track who accessed user data (PHI) for compliance:

- **AccessLogService** and **LogResourceAccess** middleware log view/create/update/delete/export on profile, user, user-settings, and search routes (`GET /api/search`, `GET /api/search/suggestions`) when they return user data. The middleware automatically extracts **fields accessed** from request bodies (create/update) and JSON responses (view); sensitive keys (e.g. password, token) are excluded.
- **HIPAA access logging** can be disabled via Configuration > Log retention (toggle “Enable HIPAA access logging”). When disabled, no new access logs are created. “Delete all access logs” is then available; it shows a HIPAA violation warning (6-year retention) before confirming.
- **ACCESS_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS**: Retention in days (default 2190 = 6 years). Do not reduce below 6 years for HIPAA.
- Access logs are included in backups and restored with merge-by-ID.

See [Recipe: Add access logging](ai/recipes/add-access-logging.md) and [Patterns: AccessLogService](ai/patterns.md#accesslogservice-pattern-hipaa-access-logging).

## Log Retention and Cleanup

Retention is configurable per log type (Configuration > **Log retention**):

- **Application logs**: 1–365 days (default 90). Applies to daily log files (`laravel-*.log`).
- **Audit logs**: 30–730 days (default 365).
- **Access logs**: Minimum 2190 days (6 years) for HIPAA; cannot be reduced.

Run cleanup via CLI:

- `php artisan log:cleanup` — delete entries and files older than retention.
- `php artisan log:cleanup --dry-run` — report what would be deleted.
- `php artisan log:cleanup --archive` — export audit and access logs to CSV in `storage/app/log-archive/` before deleting.

Retention values and the HIPAA toggle are stored in system settings (group `logging`); env fallbacks: `LOG_APP_RETENTION_DAYS`, `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, `ACCESS_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, `HIPAA_ACCESS_LOGGING_ENABLED`.

## Suspicious Activity Alerting

The system checks audit and access logs for suspicious patterns and notifies admins:

- **Failed logins**: 5+ failed login attempts in 15 minutes.
- **Bulk export**: 10+ data export (PHI) actions in 1 hour.

Scheduled command `php artisan log:check-suspicious` runs every 15 minutes and sends in-app and email notifications to all admin users. The dashboard shows an alert banner when current checks detect suspicious activity. API: `GET /api/suspicious-activity` (admin) returns current alerts for the dashboard.
