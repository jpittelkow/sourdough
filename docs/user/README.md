### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone.

#### Enabling 2FA

1. Go to **User menu** → **Security**
2. In the **Two-Factor Authentication** section, turn the switch **On** (or click to enable)
3. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app:
   - Google Authenticator
   - Authy
   - 1Password
   - Microsoft Authenticator

5. **Save your recovery codes** in a secure location

#### Using 2FA

When logging in:
1. Enter your email and password
2. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
3. Or use a recovery code if you don't have your device

#### Recovery Codes

- 10 one-time codes are generated when you enable 2FA
- Each code can only be used once
- Store them securely (password manager, printed copy)
- Regenerate codes if you've used several

#### Disabling 2FA

1. Go to **User menu** → **Security**
2. In the **Two-Factor Authentication** section, turn the switch **Off**
3. 2FA is now disabled

### Passkeys (when enabled by your administrator)

Passkeys let you sign in with your fingerprint, face, or a hardware security key instead of (or in addition to) your password. They are phishing-resistant and work on supported browsers.

#### Adding a passkey

1. Go to **User menu** → **Security**
2. In the **Passkeys** section, click **Add Passkey**
3. Enter a name (e.g. "MacBook" or "Phone")
4. Follow your device prompt to create the passkey (fingerprint, face, or security key)
5. The passkey is saved and can be used to sign in

#### Signing in with a passkey

1. On the login page, click **Sign in with Passkey**
2. Use your device prompt when asked
3. You'll be signed in

#### Removing a passkey

1. Go to **User menu** → **Security**

### Configuring AI Providers

Sourdough supports multiple AI providers. Configure the ones you want to use:

#### Adding a Provider

1. Go to **Configuration > AI** (admin only)
2. Click **Add Provider**
3. Select a provider (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, or Ollama)
4. **For API-based providers (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini):**
   - Enter your API key
   - Click **Test** to validate the key (shows checkmark if valid)
   - Click **Fetch Models** to load available models from the provider
   - Select a model from the dropdown
5. **For Ollama (local):**
   - Enter the Ollama host URL (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`)
   - Click **Test** to verify connection
   - Click **Fetch Models** to load models installed on your Ollama server
   - Select a model from the dropdown
6. Click **Add Provider** to save

**Model Discovery**: The system automatically fetches available models from each provider's API, so you always see the latest models your API key has access to. Model lists are cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls.

#### Getting API Keys

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
- **OpenAI**: Get an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)

## Backup & Restore

Access via **Configuration > Backup** (admin users only). Full backup documentation: [Backup & Restore (docs hub)](../backup.md).

The Backup page has two tabs:

- **Backups** – Create, download, restore, and delete backups.
- **Settings** – Configure retention, schedule, and remote destinations (S3, SFTP, Google Drive). Admins with **manage-settings** can edit these; changes take effect without restart.

### Creating a Backup

1. Go to **Configuration > Backup**
2. Open the **Backups** tab
3. Click **Create Backup**
4. Wait for the backup to complete
5. Download the backup file if desired

### What's Included in Backups

- **Database** – All application data (users, settings, notifications, etc.)
- **Uploaded files** – Everything under storage (avatars, attachments, etc.)
- **Application settings** – Stored in the database (sensitive values handled securely)

Backups are ZIP archives with a manifest (version 2.0). See [ADR-007: Backup System Design](../adr/007-backup-system-design.md) for format details.

### Downloading Backups

1. Go to **Configuration > Backup** > **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup in the list (filename, size, date)
3. Click **Download**
4. Save the `.zip` file securely

### Restoring from Backup

1. Go to **Configuration > Backup** > **Backups** tab
2. Either choose an existing backup and click **Restore**, or use **Upload Backup** to select a `.zip` file
3. In the restore dialog, type **RESTORE** to confirm
4. Click **Restore Backup**

> **Warning**: Restoring replaces all current data (database, files, settings). This action cannot be undone.

### Backup Settings (Admins)

Under **Configuration > Backup** > **Settings** tab you can configure:

- **Retention** – How long to keep backups and how many to keep
- **Schedule** – Enable scheduled backups; set frequency (daily/weekly/monthly), time, and destinations
- **S3 / SFTP / Google Drive** – Remote storage credentials; use **Test Connection** after saving to verify
- **Encryption** – Optional password-based encryption for backup files
- **Notifications** – Notify on backup success or failure (when notifications are configured)

Save changes with **Save Changes**. Test Connection uses the saved settings; save before testing if you just edited credentials.

### Scheduled Backups

If enabled by your administrator in **Configuration > Backup** > **Settings**:

- Backups run automatically (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- Retention rules clean up old backups
- Backups can be stored locally and/or remotely (S3, SFTP, Google Drive)

---

## Administration (Admins)

Admin-only configuration is under **Configuration** in the main navigation (requires admin/manager role).

### User Management

Access via **Configuration > Users** (`/configuration/users`).

- **List users**: View all users with pagination and search by name or email. Columns show user, email, status (Active/Disabled, Verified/Unverified), and created date.
- **Create user**: Click **Create User**. Enter name, email, and password. Optionally grant admin privileges. Use **Skip email verification** to create the user as already verified; otherwise a verification email is sent if email is configured.
- **Edit user**: Use the actions menu on a user row to edit name, email, password, and group memberships (admin role is via the admin group).
- **Disable/enable user**: Use **Disable User** or **Enable User** from the actions menu. Disabled users cannot log in. You cannot disable your own account or the last admin.
- **Resend verification email**: For unverified users, use **Resend Verification Email** from the actions menu. Rate limited to once per 5 minutes per user.
- **Reset password**: Use **Reset Password** from the actions menu and enter a new password for the user.
- **Delete user**: Use **Delete** from the actions menu. You cannot delete your own account or the last admin.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Administrators can enable SSO providers so users can sign in with their existing accounts (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.).

#### Supported Providers

- Google
- GitHub
- Microsoft (Azure AD / Entra ID)
- Apple
- Discord
- GitLab
- Generic OIDC (Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, etc.)

#### Setting Up an SSO Provider

1. Navigate to **Configuration > SSO**
2. Click **Setup instructions** on the provider card
3. Follow the steps to create an OAuth app in the provider's developer console
4. Copy the redirect URI shown and add it to your OAuth app's allowed redirect URIs
5. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret from the provider
6. Click **Test connection** to verify credentials
7. Enable the provider toggle to show it on the login page
8. Click **Save** to apply changes for that provider

Global options (Enable SSO, Allow account linking, Auto-register, Trust provider email) are in the **Global options** card; save them separately with that card's Save button.

#### Provider-Specific Notes

### Customizing System Emails

Access via **Configuration > Email Templates** (`/configuration/email-templates`).

You can customize the content of system-generated emails (password reset, email verification, welcome, notifications):

1. Open **Configuration > Email Templates**
2. Click a template (e.g. **Password Reset**) to open the editor
3. Edit the **Subject** and **Body** using the rich text editor. Use **Insert variable** to add placeholders such as `{{user.name}}` or `{{reset_url}}` that are replaced when the email is sent
4. Use the **Preview** panel on the right to see how the email will look with sample data
5. Click **Save** to apply changes
6. Use **Send test email** to send a test to an address (requires email to be configured under Configuration > Email)
7. For system templates, **Reset to default** restores the original content

Variables available for each template are listed in the template description. Inactive templates are not used when sending emails; you can disable a template without deleting it.
