| Testing | [testing.md](testing.md) | Authentication, user isolation |
| Responsive | [responsive.md](responsive.md) | Desktop-first CSS, touch targets, fixed widths, tables, mobile hook, breakpoints, landscape, hover-only, inline utilities |

## Quick Checklist

Before submitting code, verify:

- [ ] **No duplicated logic** - Searched for existing components/utilities first
- [ ] **Centralized utilities** - Common functions in `frontend/lib/utils.ts`, not inline
- [ ] **Shared components used** - Reusable functionality in `frontend/components/` or `frontend/lib/`
- [ ] Business logic is in Services, not Controllers
- [ ] All queries are user-scoped where appropriate
- [ ] PHI access routes have `log.access` middleware
- [ ] FormRequest classes used for validation
- [ ] Response format is consistent (`data`, `message`, `meta`)
- [ ] Last-admin checks use `AdminAuthorizationTrait`; pagination uses `config('app.pagination.default')`
- [ ] User password: plaintext when User has `hashed` cast; no `Hash::make()`
- [ ] Foreign keys have indexes
- [ ] Frontend has loading and error states
- [ ] Using `api` utility, not raw fetch
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs or secrets
- [ ] Admin routes have proper middleware
- [ ] Tests verify user isolation
- [ ] Form fields optional by default (`.optional()`, `mode: "onBlur"`, `reset()`)
- [ ] Custom inputs use `setValue(..., { shouldDirty: true })`
- [ ] **Mobile-first CSS** - Base styles for mobile, breakpoints for larger
- [ ] **Touch targets** - All interactive elements minimum 44px
- [ ] **Tables** - Wrapped in `overflow-x-auto` or have card view alternative
- [ ] **Tested** - Verified at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1024px+ widths
