# Security Compliance Documentation Completion - 2026-02-05

## Overview

Completed the remaining Security Compliance Review roadmap by adding template documentation for SOC 2 Processing Integrity and Confidentiality, ISO 27001 Annex A controls (A.10, A.12, A.13, A.15), employee security awareness guidelines, and expanded privileged access management. All documents follow the existing compliance template pattern with placeholders and Sourdough-specific mappings.

## Implementation Approach

- **Phase 1**: Created SOC 2 Processing Integrity Controls (PI1.1–PI1.5) and Confidentiality Controls (C1.1–C1.2); added capacity planning processes subsection to Availability Controls.
- **Phase 2**: Created ISO 27001 templates for Cryptographic Controls (A.10), Operations Security (A.12), Communications Security (A.13), and Supplier Relationships (A.15); added Security Objectives and Security Metrics sections to the ISMS Framework.
- **Phase 3**: Created Security Awareness Guidelines and expanded Access Control Policy with a full Privileged Access Management subsection (admin account management, elevated access, monitoring, emergency access).
- **Phase 4**: Updated compliance README, SOC 2 README, and ISO 27001 README with new document links; marked all roadmap checklist items complete and moved Security Compliance Review to Completed in roadmaps.md.

## Key Files Created

- `docs/compliance/soc2/processing-integrity-controls.md`
- `docs/compliance/soc2/confidentiality-controls.md`
- `docs/compliance/iso27001/cryptographic-controls.md`
- `docs/compliance/iso27001/operations-security.md`
- `docs/compliance/iso27001/communications-security.md`
- `docs/compliance/iso27001/supplier-relationships.md`
- `docs/compliance/security-awareness-guidelines.md`

## Observations

- Templates are consistent with existing compliance docs (placeholders, Control/Implementation/Evidence tables, Sourdough mapping callouts).
- Roadmap checklist is now fully checked; deployers can use the templates to perform reviews and document their own controls.

## Next Steps (Future Considerations)

- None required; roadmap is complete. Optional: add in-app links to compliance docs if In-App Documentation roadmap is pursued.
