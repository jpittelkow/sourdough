## Integration Costs

Reference for paid third-party integrations used by Sourdough. All integrations are optional — the app runs fully self-hosted with no paid services required. Costs only apply when an admin configures and enables a paid provider.

### LLM Providers (per-token/per-request)

| Provider | Pricing Model | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o) | Per input/output token | Varies by model; GPT-4o is cheaper than GPT-4 |
| Anthropic (Claude) | Per input/output token | Varies by model tier (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) |
| Google Gemini | Per input/output token | Free tier available; paid for higher usage |
| AWS Bedrock | Per input/output token | Pay-per-use via AWS account; model pricing varies |
| Azure OpenAI | Per input/output token | Azure subscription required; same models as OpenAI |
| Ollama (local) | Free (self-hosted) | Runs on local hardware; no API costs |

**Cost amplifiers:** Aggregation mode queries all configured providers (multiplied cost); Council mode queries all providers plus a synthesis step. Single mode is the most cost-efficient.

### Email Providers (per message)

| Provider | Pricing Model | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| SMTP (self-hosted) | Free | Requires own mail server |
| Mailgun | Per email (free tier available) | 100 emails/day free, then per-email |
| SendGrid | Per email (free tier available) | 100 emails/day free, then tiered plans |
| AWS SES | Per email | ~$0.10/1,000 emails; very cost-effective at scale |
| Postmark | Per email | Transactional-focused; tiered plans |

### SMS Providers (per message)

| Provider | Pricing Model | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Twilio | Per SMS segment | Pricing varies by country; ~$0.0079/msg (US) |
| Vonage | Per SMS segment | Pricing varies by country |
| AWS SNS | Per SMS | ~$0.00645/msg (US); international rates vary |

### Storage Providers (per GB/month)

| Provider | Pricing Model | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Local disk | Free | Default; limited by server disk |
| Amazon S3 | Per GB stored + requests | ~$0.023/GB/month (Standard) |
| Google Cloud Storage | Per GB stored + requests | ~$0.020/GB/month (Standard) |
| Azure Blob Storage | Per GB stored + requests | ~$0.018/GB/month (Hot tier) |
| DigitalOcean Spaces | Flat + per GB | $5/month includes 250 GB |
| MinIO (self-hosted) | Free | S3-compatible; runs on own infrastructure |
| Backblaze B2 | Per GB stored + requests | ~$0.006/GB/month; 10 GB free |

### Real-Time / Broadcasting

| Provider | Pricing Model | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Pusher | Per connection + messages | Free tier: 200k messages/day, 100 connections. Required only for live streaming features (audit logs, app logs) |

### Notification Services (optional)

| Provider | Pricing Model | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Novu (optional) | Free tier + usage-based | Optional notification infrastructure (Cloud or self-hosted). Free for 30k events/month. Local system remains default fallback. See [ADR-025](adr/025-novu-notification-integration.md). |

### Free Integrations (no cost)

These integrations are self-hosted or free and incur no third-party costs:

- **Meilisearch** — Embedded in Docker container (self-hosted)
- **Ollama** — Local LLM inference (self-hosted)
- **SSO/OAuth providers** — Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Apple, Discord, GitLab authentication is free
- **Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix, ntfy** — Notification channels use free APIs/webhooks
- **Web Push (VAPID)** — Browser push notifications are free
- **SMTP** — Self-hosted email is free

### Cost Management Considerations

- **LLM is typically the largest cost** — Monitor token usage; prefer Single mode over Aggregation/Council for routine queries
- **Email costs are usually negligible** — Most apps send fewer than 1,000 emails/month (well within free tiers)
- **SMS is per-message** — Can add up with international recipients; consider limiting to critical notifications only
- **Storage scales with data** — Local disk is free; cloud storage costs grow with backup frequency and file uploads
- **Broadcasting is optional** — Only needed for real-time log streaming; most deployments don't require it

### Usage Dashboard (Completed 2026-02-14)

A unified **Configuration > Usage & Costs** page for admins to visualize and monitor costs across all paid integrations. Single combined chart with date range selector and integration filters.

**Phase 1: Usage Tracking (Backend)** — Done

- [x] Create `integration_usage` table — columns: `id`, `integration`, `provider`, `metric`, `quantity`, `estimated_cost`, `metadata` (JSON), `user_id` (nullable), `created_at`
- [x] Create `IntegrationUsage` model with scopes: `byIntegration()`, `byProvider()`, `byDateRange()`, `byUser()`
- [x] Create `UsageTrackingService` — `record()` method plus convenience methods (`recordLLM`, `recordEmail`, `recordSMS`, `recordStorage`, `recordBroadcast`)
- [x] Instrument LLM calls — log tokens in/out, provider, model, and estimated cost in `LLMOrchestrator::logRequest()`. Cost estimation uses configurable per-model rates from `settings-schema.php` with default fallbacks
- [x] Instrument email sends — log per-send in `EmailChannel` with provider name
- [x] Instrument SMS sends — log per-message in `TwilioChannel`, `VonageChannel`, `SNSChannel` with provider and recipient country
- [x] Instrument storage operations — log upload/download size in `StorageService` for cloud providers only (skip local)
- [ ] Instrument broadcasting — log connection events if Pusher is configured (optional, lower priority)

**Phase 2: Usage Stats API (Backend)** — Done

- [x] Create `UsageController` — protected by `can:usage.view` permission, routes under `/api/usage`
- [x] `GET /api/usage/stats` — aggregated usage data with query params: `date_from`, `date_to`, `integration`, `provider`, `group_by`
- [x] Response shape: `{ summary: { total_estimated_cost, by_integration }, daily: [...], by_provider: [...] }`
- [x] `GET /api/usage/breakdown` — detailed breakdown for a single integration (LLM by model, per-user attribution)
- [x] Add `usage` group to `settings-schema.php` for pricing, budgets, and alert threshold

**Phase 3: Usage Dashboard (Frontend)** — Done

- [x] Add **Configuration > Usage & Costs** page at `/configuration/usage`
- [x] Add "Usage & Costs" menu item to Configuration navigation (Logs & Monitoring group) with `usage.view` permission
- [x] **Date range selector** — Two `<Input type="date">` fields plus preset buttons (Last 7/30/90 days, This month, Last month)
- [x] **Summary stat cards** — Reusing `AuditStatsCard` pattern: Total Cost, LLM, Email, SMS, Storage, Broadcasting
- [x] **Combined cost chart** — Recharts stacked `AreaChart` with `ChartContainer`, `ChartTooltip`, `ChartLegend`
- [x] **Integration filter** — Toggle buttons to show/hide integration types on chart and stat cards
- [x] **Provider breakdown table** — Sortable table: Provider, Integration, Total Units, Est. Cost, with totals row
- [x] **Empty state** — Message explaining usage tracking begins once paid integrations are used

**Phase 4: Cost Alerts & Export** — Done

- [x] **Cost alerts** — Configurable monthly budget per integration; `UsageAlertService` + `CheckUsageBudgetsCommand` (daily schedule) notify admins at threshold and 100%
- [x] **CSV export** — `GET /api/usage/export` streams CSV with chunked queries (protected by `can:logs.export`)
- [x] **Per-user breakdown** — `GET /api/usage/breakdown` includes per-user cost attribution for LLM and SMS
- [x] **Dashboard widget** — `UsageDashboardWidget` on admin dashboard showing current month total + mini sparkline trend

**Optional remaining work:**
- [ ] Additional LLM pricing presets for newer models (e.g. Claude 4, GPT-5)
- [ ] Broadcasting instrumentation via Pusher event listener (low priority, most deployments don't use broadcasting)
- [ ] Provider filter dropdown on the Usage page (currently filters by integration toggle only, not individual provider)

## Roadmap Maintenance

When adding or updating roadmaps:

1. **New roadmaps**: Add to appropriate section (Active, Next Up, or Planned) with priority
2. **Completing work**: Move to Completed section with date, note any remaining optional work
3. **Verify links**: Ensure all roadmap file links resolve correctly
4. **Journal entries**: Add implementation notes to the Journal Entries table

## Build Verification

To verify the build works end-to-end:

1. Clean rebuild: `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d --build`
2. Wait for startup, then access http://localhost:8080
3. Test: login flow, dashboard loads, configuration pages work
4. Check browser console for errors

**Production build verified 2026-02-15**: Docker build, registration, login, dashboard, configuration pages all working. Production standalone mode is clean.

**Known dev-mode issues** (do not affect production):
- The dev compose (`docker-compose.yml`) runs Next.js in Turbopack dev mode. After a `down -v` (which deletes the `node_modules` volume), the `start-nextjs.sh` script auto-installs dependencies but Turbopack may produce stale module chunks for `lib/utils.ts` (e.g. `formatCurrency is not a function`). Workaround: restart the container once after the initial `npm install` completes, or test with a production container (`docker run` without source mounts).
- Hydration mismatch warning (debug level) from Sonner Toaster's deferred client-side mount — cosmetic only, does not crash production builds.
