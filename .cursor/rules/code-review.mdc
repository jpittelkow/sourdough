# Code Review

Run code review before considering a task done. Use the quick checks below; for the full checklist and project-specific checks, use the [Code Review recipe](docs/ai/recipes/code-review.md).

## When to Review

- Before marking your task complete
- After implementing features
- After refactoring
- When explicitly asked (e.g. code-reviewer agent)

Before marking your task complete, run through the recipe checklist (or the quick checks below) and fix any issues.

## Quick Checks (Must Pass)

- **No debug code** – Remove `dd()`, `dump()`, `console.log`, `debugger`, etc.
- **No hardcoded secrets** – Use `config()` and env, not credentials in code
- **User scoping** – Queries that return user data filter by `user_id` (or equivalent)
- **Admin routes protected** – Admin endpoints use `auth:sanctum` and `admin` middleware

## Full Checklist

For the full checklist and project-specific checks (Laravel, React, deprecated patterns, etc.), use [docs/ai/recipes/code-review.md](docs/ai/recipes/code-review.md).
