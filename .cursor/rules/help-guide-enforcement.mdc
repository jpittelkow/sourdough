# Help Guide Enforcement

When adding or modifying a feature that has a configuration page or user-facing functionality:

1. **Check** if a help article exists in `frontend/lib/help/help-content.ts` for this feature
2. **Create** one if missing — follow `docs/ai/recipes/add-help-article.md`
3. **Update** it if it exists but the feature behavior changed
4. **Add a HelpLink** to the config page if not already present
5. **Add/update** the search entry in `backend/config/search-pages.php` with the `help:` URL prefix and correct `permission` field

When removing a feature:

1. **Remove** the corresponding help article from `frontend/lib/help/help-content.ts`
2. **Remove** the search entry from `backend/config/search-pages.php`
3. **Remove** any `HelpLink` references from deleted pages

Help categories are permission-gated (not admin-only). Match the category's `permission` field to the config page's required permission. See `docs/ai/recipes/add-help-article.md` for the full category-to-permission mapping.
