# Journaling & Documentation

When completing significant development work, create documentation to maintain project history and knowledge.

## Journal Entries

Create a journal entry in `docs/journal/` for significant changes (new features, refactors, architecture changes).

**Filename format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

**Required sections**:

```markdown
# [Feature/Change Name] - [Date]

## Overview
Brief summary of what was implemented and why.

## Implementation Approach
- Component/service architecture decisions
- Key technical choices made

## Challenges Encountered
Problems faced and how they were solved.

## Observations
- Insights gained during implementation
- Code quality improvements
- Patterns worth noting

## Trade-offs
Decisions made and their implications.

## Next Steps (Future Considerations)
Potential future improvements or related work.

## Testing Notes
Key areas to verify.
```

## Documentation Updates

When making changes, update relevant documentation:

- **New features/APIs**: Update `docs/features.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, and `docs/user-docs.md`
- **Architecture changes**: Create/update ADRs in `docs/adr/` and update `docs/architecture.md` with file references
- **Configuration changes**: Update `docs/development.md` or `docs/docker.md`
- **Roadmap items**: Update `docs/roadmaps.md` when completing planned work
- **Breaking changes**: Update README and CHANGELOG

See `docs/overview.md` for the complete documentation structure.

## When to Document

- New components, services, or significant modules
- Refactoring that changes structure or patterns
- Bug fixes with non-obvious solutions
- Configuration or infrastructure changes
- Decisions with trade-offs worth recording
