# Get Cooking — New Project Setup Wizard

When the user says **"Get cooking"** (or variations like "get cooking", "let's cook", "start cooking"), begin the tiered setup wizard.

## Before Starting

1. Read the master setup recipe: `docs/ai/recipes/setup-new-project.md`
2. Read the current environment: `.env.example`, `frontend/config/app.ts`, `frontend/config/fonts.ts`
3. Read `FORK-ME.md` for context on what Sourdough provides

## Step 1: Welcome & Orient the User

**Before asking any tier questions**, present this to the user:

### Wizard Overview

Greet the user and explain the setup process conversationally. Cover these points:

> "Let's get your project set up! This is a **3-tier wizard** — I'll ask you some questions, make the changes, and then you can decide if you want to keep going or pause and come back later."

Present the wizard outline so the user knows what to expect:

| Tier | Focus | What Happens |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **1. Identity & Branding** | Name, colors, fonts, logo | Renames "Sourdough" everywhere, sets your look & feel |
| **2. Features & Auth** | Which features to keep, auth model | Removes what you don't need, configures login |
| **3. Infrastructure & Repo** | Database, ports, git setup | Configures the runtime and prepares the repo |

Tell them: *"You can stop after any tier and pick up where you left off later. Each tier takes effect immediately, so your app is usable after every step."*

### Quick Tips

Then share the Quick Tips so the user knows the key shortcuts from the start. Present these conversationally using the "just say..." tone:

**Releasing code:**

| Just say | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| **"push"** | Commits all changes, bumps patch version, tags, and pushes |
| **"push minor"** | Same but bumps minor version (new feature set) |
| **"push major"** | Same but bumps major version (breaking change) |
| **"push — added user dashboard"** | Uses your message as the commit message |

**Planning features:**
- Say **"Add ___ to the roadmap"** — I'll create a plan file and track it
- Say **"Work on ___"** — I'll load the plan and start building
- Say **"What's on the roadmap?"** — I'll review what's active, next, and planned

**Building things:**

| Just say | What I'll do |
|----------|-------------|
| "Add an API endpoint for widgets" | Follow the API endpoint recipe |
| "Add a config page for my feature" | Follow the config page recipe |
| "Add a dashboard widget for stats" | Follow the dashboard widget recipe |
| "Review my code" | Run the full code review checklist |

There are **36 step-by-step recipes** — you don't need to know which one, just describe what you want.

**How I work:** This codebase is built for AI-assisted development. I automatically load context, follow tested recipes, run code reviews, and keep docs updated.

### Then proceed

After presenting the overview and Quick Tips, say: **"Ready to start with Tier 1?"** and wait for confirmation before proceeding to the Tier 1 questions below.

---

## How the Tiers Work

The wizard has **three tiers** of questions. After each tier, execute the corresponding recipe **immediately** before moving to the next tier. This lets the user stop at any tier boundary and continue later.

At each tier boundary, ask: **"Ready for the next round, or want to stop here and continue later?"**

If the user stops early, tell them which tier they completed and what's left.

---

## Tier 1: Identity & Branding

**Ask these questions first** (present conversationally, not as a wall of text):

1. **App name?** — Used in title bar, emails, auth pages, PWA manifest, sidebar, everywhere. (Default: Sourdough)
2. **Short name / abbreviation?** — 1-3 characters for collapsed sidebar and PWA icon text. (Default: SD)
3. **One-line description?** — For README, meta tags, PWA manifest description.
4. **Primary brand color?** — Hex code, color name, or "describe it." (Default: `#3b82f6` blue)
5. **Font style preference?** — Show this table:

| Style | Body Font | Heading Font |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Clean & modern (default) | Inter | Newsreader |
| Geometric & modern | DM Sans | DM Serif Display |
| Friendly & warm | Plus Jakarta Sans | Lora |
| Techy / developer | Geist Sans | Geist Mono |
| Corporate & classic | Source Sans 3 | Playfair Display |
| Creative & bold | Poppins | Abril Fatface |
| Soft & readable | Nunito | Merriweather |

6. **Logo file, or text for now?** — Can always upload later via Configuration > Branding.

**After collecting answers → execute `docs/ai/recipes/setup-identity-branding.md`**

---

## Tier 2: Features & Auth

**Ask these questions next:**

1. **Which features to keep?** Present as a checklist (defaults = keep all):
   - [ ] AI/LLM integration (multi-provider, 3 orchestration modes)
   - [ ] Notification channels — which ones? (Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack, SMS, Matrix, ntfy, Web Push, In-App)
   - [ ] Backup/restore — which destinations? (Local, S3, SFTP, Google Drive)
   - [ ] PWA (installable app, offline support)
   - [ ] Full-text search (Meilisearch)
   - [ ] HIPAA/access logging (warn: this is woven into core middleware — removal is deeper surgery)

2. **Auth model?** Each tier builds on the previous:
   - Email/password only (simplest)
   - \+ SSO (adds OAuth login buttons)
   - \+ 2FA (adds TOTP + recovery codes)
   - \+ Passkeys (adds WebAuthn/FIDO2 passwordless login)
   - Default: Email/password + optional SSO

3. **Which SSO providers?** (only if SSO selected): Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Apple, Discord, GitLab

**After collecting answers → execute `docs/ai/recipes/setup-features-auth.md`**

---

## Tier 3: Infrastructure & Repository

**Ask these questions last:**

1. **Database?** — SQLite (simplest, default), MySQL, or PostgreSQL. All migrations are database-agnostic.
2. **Dev port?** — Default 8080. Change if it conflicts with other services.
3. **Target deployment?** — Docker local (default), cloud VPS, or NAS (Unraid/Synology). Affects PUID/PGID guidance.
4. **Timezone?** — Default UTC. Set to your local timezone if preferred (e.g., `America/Chicago`).
5. **Mail from address?** — e.g., `hello@yourdomain.com`. Or skip for now.
6. **GitHub repo URL?** — Or "later."
7. **Reset git history or keep Sourdough's?** — Default: fresh start (`git init`).

**After collecting answers → execute `docs/ai/recipes/setup-infrastructure-repo.md`**

---

## After All Tiers

Run the verification steps from `docs/ai/recipes/setup-infrastructure-repo.md` Step 7.

Then **remind the user** of the Quick Tips you showed at the start (brief recap — don't repeat the full tables) and present the **Key Documentation** and **Working with Roadmaps** details below.

Recap example: *"As a reminder — just say **"push"** to release code, **"Add ___ to the roadmap"** to plan features, and describe what you want to build and I'll find the right recipe. Here's where to find key docs..."*

### Key Documentation

| Doc | What's there |
|-----|-------------|
| `docs/ai/README.md` | AI development guide — recipes, patterns, gotchas |
| `docs/roadmaps.md` | Development plans and progress tracking |
| `docs/features.md` | What's currently implemented |
| `docs/ai/patterns/` | Code patterns with copy-paste examples |
| `docs/ai/anti-patterns/` | Common mistakes to avoid |

---

## Working with Roadmaps (Details)

The roadmap system at `docs/roadmaps.md` tracks all planned, in-progress, and completed work. This section has the behind-the-scenes details for how the AI manages roadmaps.

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Create a plan file** at `docs/plans/<feature-name>-roadmap.md` with phased implementation steps
2. **Add an entry** to the appropriate section in `docs/roadmaps.md`:
   - **Active Development** — Currently being worked on (limit this to avoid context-switching)
   - **Next Up** — Ready to start, unblocked
   - **Planned Features** — Requires planning or foundation work
3. Include a checkbox `- [ ]` and a brief description with a link to the plan file

### Working from the Roadmap

1. **Check `docs/roadmaps.md`** before starting new work — is it already planned?
2. **Move the item to Active Development** when you start working on it
3. **Read the plan file** for detailed phases and implementation steps
4. **Follow the development workflow**: load context, find applicable recipes, implement, update docs
5. **Journal your work** in `docs/journal/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` when completing significant changes

### Completing Roadmap Items

1. **Move the item** from Active to **Completed (Core Done)** or **Completed (Fully Done)**
2. Add the completion date and note any remaining optional work
3. **Update `docs/features.md`** if the feature is user-facing
4. **Update `docs/ai/context-loading.md`** if new files were created that future tasks should know about
5. **Update recipes/patterns** if new patterns emerged during implementation

### Roadmap Structure

```
docs/roadmaps.md           # Master tracking file
docs/plans/                 # Detailed plan files (one per feature/initiative)
docs/journal/               # Implementation history (one entry per significant change)
docs/adr/                   # Architecture Decision Records (for significant design choices)
```

## Resuming

If the user returns and says "Get cooking" again (or "continue setup", "resume cooking"), check what has already been done:
- If app name is no longer "Sourdough" → Tier 1 is done
- If features have been removed → Tier 2 is done
- If git history has been reset → Tier 3 is done

Pick up from the next incomplete tier.
