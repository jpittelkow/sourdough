# Roadmap Maintenance

Always keep `docs/roadmaps.md` and individual roadmap files updated as work progresses.

## When to Update Roadmaps

Update roadmaps when:

- **Completing tasks** in a roadmap (mark complete, add completion date)
- **Starting work** on a roadmap item (move to Active Development)
- **Creating new roadmap files** (add link to `docs/roadmaps.md`)
- **Changing priorities** or dependencies
- **Discovering blockers** that affect planned work

## Updating docs/roadmaps.md

### Moving Items Between Sections

```markdown
## Active Development    ← Currently working on
## Next Up               ← Ready when Active items complete
## Planned Features      ← Requires foundation work
## Completed             ← Done (include completion date)
```

### Completion Checklist

When completing a roadmap:

1. Move from current section to **Completed**
2. Add completion date: `| [Name](path) | 2026-01-27 |`
3. Update any roadmaps that depended on it

### New Roadmap Checklist

When creating a new roadmap file in `docs/plans/`:

1. Create the file with clear phases/tasks
2. **ALWAYS add link to `docs/roadmaps.md`** in appropriate section
3. Include priority and dependencies in the table

## Updating Individual Roadmap Files

Mark tasks complete with checkboxes:

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
```

Update phase status when all tasks complete:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Setup ✅ COMPLETE
## Phase 2: Implementation ← IN PROGRESS
```

## Verification

Before finishing work, verify:

- [ ] `docs/roadmaps.md` reflects current status
- [ ] Completed items have dates
- [ ] New roadmaps are linked
- [ ] Individual roadmap checkboxes updated
