# Development Workflow

## Before Any Work
1. Read docs/ai/README.md - find your task type in the context loading table
2. Read the files listed for your task type (docs/ai/context-loading.md has full details)
3. Read applicable recipes from docs/ai/recipes/
4. Read applicable patterns from docs/ai/patterns/ (specific files, not all)
5. Check docs/roadmaps.md if the task might be planned work

## During Work
- Follow patterns from docs/ai/patterns/
- Avoid anti-patterns from docs/ai/anti-patterns/
- Check for existing components/utilities before creating new ones (frontend/components/, frontend/lib/)
- Docker changes? Include Dockerfile/docker-compose/entrypoint/.env.example updates

## After Work (MANDATORY)
- Update relevant docs (features, architecture, patterns, anti-patterns, recipes, ADRs, context-loading)
- Update docs/roadmaps.md if completing planned work
- Journal significant changes in docs/journal/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md (template in docs/ai/documentation-guide.md)
- Run code review: docs/ai/recipes/code-review.md

## Quick Checks (Must Pass Before Done)
- No debug code (dd, dump, console.log, debugger)
- No hardcoded secrets - use config() and env
- User scoping on data queries (user_id filter)
- Admin routes protected (auth:sanctum + can:permission)
- PHI access routes have log.access middleware
- Frontend errors use errorLogger, not console.error
- Mobile-first CSS (base styles for mobile, md:/lg: for larger)
