# Tool Selection

When adding new external tools or dependencies to the project:

1. **Check [OpenAlternative.co](https://openalternative.co/)** for open-source alternatives
2. Prefer open-source, self-hostable options when available
3. Consider: license compatibility, maintenance activity, community size
4. Document significant tool choices in journal or ADR
