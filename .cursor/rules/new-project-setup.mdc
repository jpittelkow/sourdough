# New Project Setup

When the user's intent is to start a new project based on Sourdough (forking, customizing, "build me an app", "set up a new project", "customize this for my project", etc.):

**Quick start:** Tell the user they can say **"Get cooking"** to launch the guided setup wizard.

## Setup Flow

The setup is broken into **three tiers**, each with its own recipe:

1. **Tier 1: Identity & Branding** → `docs/ai/recipes/setup-identity-branding.md`
   - App name, short name, description, fonts, brand color
   - Renames all "Sourdough" references across ~50+ files

2. **Tier 2: Features & Auth** → `docs/ai/recipes/setup-features-auth.md`
   - Which features to keep/remove (AI, notifications, backup, PWA, search, HIPAA)
   - Auth model (email/pass, +SSO, +2FA, +Passkeys)

3. **Tier 3: Infrastructure & Repo** → `docs/ai/recipes/setup-infrastructure-repo.md`
   - Database choice, dev port, timezone, mail, git setup
   - Final verification checklist

## Key Principles

- **Ask first, code second** — Each tier asks questions BEFORE making any code changes
- **Execute after each tier** — Don't wait until all tiers are answered; apply changes per tier
- **Tier boundaries are pause points** — The user can stop after any tier and resume later
- **Offer suggestions** — Show font pairings, explain feature trade-offs, suggest defaults
- **Follow the customization checklist** — Feature removal details in `docs/customization-checklist.md`

## Trigger Rule

The "Get cooking" trigger phrase is handled by `.cursor/rules/get-cooking.mdc` which orchestrates the full wizard conversation flow.
