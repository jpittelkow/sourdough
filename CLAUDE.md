# Sourdough

> **STOP. Before doing ANY work, you MUST read the documentation files below using the Read tool. This is mandatory for every task, every conversation. No exceptions.**

## Required Reading (MUST read before any work)

1. **[docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md)** - Main documentation index (READ FIRST)
2. **[docs/ai/README.md](docs/ai/README.md)** - AI development guide with patterns and recipes
3. **[docs/ai/context-loading.md](docs/ai/context-loading.md)** - Which files to read for your specific task type

Then follow the context-loading guide to read the additional files relevant to your task.

**Using as a Template**: See [FORK-ME.md](FORK-ME.md) for instructions on using Sourdough as a base for your own project.
